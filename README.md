## Facebook WinForm
Facebook WinForm is a Windows application using C#, .NET framework and Winforms.

## About
The Facebook WinForm project is a Windows Forms application designed to interact with the Facebook API, allowing users to seamlessly log in and access their profile details, photos, and posts. This application also introduces two exciting new features:

**Slide Show:** This feature randomly selects images from various albums, providing users with a nostalgic journey through their past moments captured on Facebook.

**Find My Team:** Leveraging your current friends list, this feature identifies individuals who share common hobbies. By selecting pages and groups related to your interests, you can filter your friends list to discover potential new connections.

## Methodology and Design:
This application is built upon the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), emphasizing modularity, flexibility, and maintainability.
Design patterns have been employed to enhance code organization and scalability.
The following design patterns have been implemented:
- Factory Method: Used to create instances of objects based on user preferences, enhancing flexibility and extensibility.
- Adapter: Facilitates the integration of different components by providing a standardized interface.
- Facade: Provides a simplified interface to a set of complex subsystems, improving ease of use.
- Iterator: Enables efficient traversal of data structures, enhancing the accessibility and management of collections.
- Strategy: Allows dynamic selection of algorithms at runtime, providing flexibility in algorithmic implementations.
- Decorator: Offers a flexible way to extend the functionality of classes, enabling the addition of new features without altering existing code.

In addition to these design patterns, multithreading techniques have been employed to ensure client responsiveness. This allows the application to handle multiple tasks concurrently, providing a smoother user experience.
Furthermore, data binding has been implemented to establish dynamic connections between the user interface and underlying data sources. This ensures that the correct data is displayed and updated in real-time based on user interactions.
These design choices not only contribute to the project's structural integrity but also lay the foundation for future expansions and improvements.
